= Antora Training Extension

This extension adds additional data on training pages.

== Installation

Begin by installing the extension package into your playbook project:

 $ npm i @neo4j-documentation/antora-training-extension

We strongly recommend installing dependencies into your playbook project.
This strategy makes it easier to manage the dependencies, clearly documents those dependencies, and ensures the build is portable and isolated from other sites.

== Usage

Now that you have the extension installed, you need to register the extension with Antora.
To register the extension, you'll add an entry that cites the name of the package to the `antora.extensions` key in your Antora playbook file.

Open the Antora playbook file and add the extension as follows:

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
  - '@neo4j-documentation/antora-training-extension'
----
